# Data Policy for the Detention Facility Extreme Weather Tracker

This project is built on the belief that **data transparency should never come at the expense of safety**. We are committed to ethical, responsible, and community-informed data practices that center the rights and safety of detained individuals and those advocating for them.

## 1. Privacy and Protection

- We **do not collect** or share any personally identifiable information (PII), including names, ID numbers, or contact information of individuals.
- We do **not publish** the locations of safe houses, shelters, or residential facilities.
- All data shared publicly reflects **environmental conditions near public-facing or government-verified detention facilities**, not individual conditions inside those facilities.
- Community-submitted reports are reviewed, anonymized, and verified before being shared in any public format.

## 2. Data Sources

We use the following **publicly available, reputable sources**:

- OpenWeatherMap API
- NOAA/NWS Weather Alerts (U.S. only)
- Public maps of federal and state detention centers
- Verified nonprofit directories
- Contributor-verified community reports (with dual confirmation)

##  3. Open Source Standards

- We encourage other communities to replicate or improve this work, with proper attribution and adherence to these data safety principles.
